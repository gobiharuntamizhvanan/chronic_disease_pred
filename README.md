# chronic_disease_pred
I am excited to share details about my classification project focused on chronic disease prediction. In the "RandomForest Classifier," it successfully identified 35 cases confirming chronic diseases and accurately dismissed 63 false reports. Notably, it achieved a flawless record, providing zero incorrect reports.

Utilizing various algorithms such as Naive Bayes, KNN, RandomForest, Decision Tree, and SVM, we aimed to achieve high-level accuracy. Among these algorithms, RandomForest Classifier stood out for its effectiveness in chronic disease reporting. To further enhance accuracy, we are actively working on fine-tuning the model.

Stay tuned for more updates on this impactful project! üåêüí° #DataScience #HealthcareAnalytics #MachineLearning #ChronicDiseasePrediction #DataAnalysis
